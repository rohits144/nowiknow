## Introduction

If you’ve been writing Python classes just to store data, chances are you've spent time writing `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__` methods over and over. Python’s `dataclasses` module, introduced in Python 3.7, makes this process effortless. In this article, we’ll explore data classes with practical Django examples and also tackle some **advanced interview questions** to help you ace your next coding challenge!

---

## Why Use Data Classes in Python?

### ✅ Less Boilerplate Code

Instead of manually writing methods like `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__`, data classes automatically generate them for you.

### ✅ Better Readability & Maintainability

Data classes provide a clean and structured way to define models without unnecessary clutter.

### ✅ Immutable & Hashable Objects

You can make a data class **immutable** by setting `frozen=True`, preventing accidental modifications.

### ✅ Works Well with Django

Although Django’s ORM uses `models.Model`, data classes are excellent for handling **API responses**, **form validation**, and **caching layers**.

---

## Creating Your First Data Class

Let’s start with a simple example.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Employee:
    name: str
    age: int
    department: str
    salary: float

emp1 = Employee(name="Alice", age=30, department="HR", salary=60000)
print(emp1)  # Employee(name='Alice', age=30, department='HR', salary=60000)
```

In just a few lines, you get a **fully functional class** with an auto-generated `__init__` and `__repr__` method. 🚀

## Real-World Django Example: Handling API Responses

When working with Django, you often need to **process API responses**. Data classes help you structure this data efficiently.

### **Use Case: Storing Weather API Data**

Imagine your Django app fetches weather data from an external API. Instead of dealing with raw dictionaries, you can define a data class for better readability and maintainability.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
import requests

@dataclass
class WeatherData:
    city: str
    temperature: float
    humidity: int
    status: str

# Simulating an API call
def fetch_weather_data():
    response = {
        "city": "Bangalore",
        "temperature": 32.5,
        "humidity": 60,
        "status": "Sunny"
    }
    return WeatherData(**response)

weather = fetch_weather_data()
print(weather)  # WeatherData(city='Bangalore', temperature=32.5, humidity=60, status='Sunny')
```

**Why use a data class here?** ✅ Type safety ✅ Readability ✅ Structured data handling

## Advanced Data Class Features in Django

### **1️⃣ Default Values with** `field()`

Need default values for optional fields? Use `field(default=...)`.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

@dataclass
class Product:
    name: str
    price: float = 0.0  # Default price
    category: str = field(default="General")
```

---

### **2️⃣ Immutable Data Classes (**`frozen=True`)

If you want to ensure that instances remain unchanged, set `frozen=True`.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Config:
    app_name: str
    version: str

config = Config(app_name="MyApp", version="1.0")
# config.app_name = "NewApp"  # ❌ Raises FrozenInstanceError
```

---

### **3️⃣ Data Class Inheritance in Django**

Data classes support **inheritance**, which is useful when extending models.

```python
@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int

@dataclass
class Student(Person):
    grade: str

s1 = Student(name="John", age=21, grade="A")
print(s1)  # Student(name='John', age=21, grade='A')
```

## Common Interview Questions & Answers

### 🔹 **1\. How do you make a data class immutable?**

👉 Use `@dataclass(frozen=True)`. This makes attributes **read-only** after initialization.

### 🔹 **2\. Can you use data classes in Django models?**

👉 **No,** Django models require `models.Model`. However, you can use data classes for **serializing API responses**, **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**, and **configuration management**.

### 🔹 **3\. What happens when a data class contains mutable default values?**

👉 Using mutable defaults like lists can cause **unexpected behavior**. Instead, use `field(default_factory=list)`.

Example:

```python
@dataclass
class Inventory:
    items: list = field(default_factory=list)  # ✅ Correct way
```

### 🔹 **4\. How does data class inheritance work?**

👉 A child data class **inherits attributes and behavior** from the parent, just like normal Python classes.

### 🔹 **5\. How do data classes compare with NamedTuples?**

| Feature | Data Classes | NamedTuples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mutable | ✅ Yes (unless frozen) | ❌ No |
| Type Hinting | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Supports Methods | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |

## Conclusion

Python’s `dataclass` module is a **powerful yet simple** way to manage structured data in your applications. Whether you're working with **Django APIs, caching layers, or DTOs**, data classes can make your code more **readable, maintainable, and bug-free**.
